# Mouse Wheel Zoom Improvements

## Summary of Changes Applied

I've successfully implemented all the recommended improvements to fix the jumpy mouse wheel zoom behavior in the Vertex Web SDK:

### 1. ✅ Removed Artificial Delta Splitting

- **File**: `packages/viewer/src/lib/interactions/baseInteractionHandler.ts`
- **Change**: Removed `SCROLL_WHEEL_DELTA_PERCENTAGES` array and the forEach loop that split each wheel event into 5 separate micro-interactions
- **Result**: Single smooth zoom operation per wheel event instead of artificial stepping

### 2. ✅ Added RequestAnimationFrame Batching

- **File**: `packages/viewer/src/lib/interactions/baseInteractionHandler.ts`
- **Change**: Added `pendingWheelZoom` accumulation with `requestAnimationFrame` processing
- **Result**: Wheel events are batched and processed at consistent frame rates like touch interactions

### 3. ✅ Implemented Zoom Accumulation

- **File**: `packages/viewer/src/lib/interactions/mouseInteractions.ts`
- **Change**: Added `wheelAccumulator` and `wheelAccumulatorTimer` to `ZoomInteraction` class
- **Result**: Rapid wheel events are accumulated over 16ms windows (~60fps) for ultra-smooth zooming

### 4. ✅ Improved Configuration

- **File**: `packages/viewer/src/lib/types/interactions.ts`
- **Change**: Reduced `mouseWheelInteractionEndDebounce` from 350ms to 150ms
- **Result**: More responsive zoom interaction ending

### 5. ✅ Added Proper Cleanup

- **File**: `packages/viewer/src/lib/interactions/mouseInteractions.ts`
- **Change**: Added `stopWheelAccumulator()` method and proper timer cleanup
- **Result**: No memory leaks or hanging timers

## Key Technical Improvements

### Before (Jumpy Behavior):

```typescript
// Old problematic approach
SCROLL_WHEEL_DELTA_PERCENTAGES.forEach((percentage, index) => {
  window.setTimeout(() => {
    const zoomDelta = delta * percentage;
    this.zoomInteraction.zoomToPoint(point, zoomDelta, api);
  }, index * 2);
});
```

### After (Smooth Behavior):

```typescript
// New smooth approach with batching
if (this.pendingWheelZoom) {
  this.pendingWheelZoom.delta += delta;
} else {
  this.pendingWheelZoom = { point, delta };
  requestAnimationFrame(() => this.processWheelZoom());
}

// With accumulation in ZoomInteraction
this.wheelAccumulator += delta;
this.wheelAccumulatorTimer = window.setTimeout(() => {
  if (Math.abs(this.wheelAccumulator) > 0.1) {
    this.operateWithTimer(api, () =>
      api.zoomCameraToPoint(pt, this.getDirectionalDelta(this.wheelAccumulator))
    );
  }
  this.wheelAccumulator = 0;
}, 16); // 60fps
```

## Expected Results

With these changes, mouse wheel zoom should now:

1. **Feel as smooth as touch/drag zoom** - No more artificial stepping or jumpiness
2. **Be more responsive** - Faster interaction ending (150ms vs 350ms)
3. **Handle rapid scrolling better** - Accumulation prevents overwhelming the interaction system
4. **Maintain consistent performance** - Frame-rate aligned processing like other input methods
5. **Be more resource efficient** - Single interaction context instead of multiple micro-interactions

## Testing Recommendation

To verify the improvements:

1. Test mouse wheel zoom on various models
2. Compare with two-finger drag zoom and shift+drag zoom for consistency
3. Try rapid wheel scrolling to ensure smooth accumulation
4. Test on different devices/browsers with varying wheel sensitivities

The changes maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving the user experience for mouse wheel zooming.
