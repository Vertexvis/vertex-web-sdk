/**

 * This is definitely confusing, but the main reason to use this transform is to
 * set up a view matrix for a camera that's looking at a certain point. To
 * achieve the effect of moving the camera somewhere and rotating it so that it
 * points at something, the rest of the world is moved in the opposite direction
 * and rotated in the opposite way around the camera. This way, you get the same
 * effect as moving the actual camera, but all the projection math can still be
 * done with the camera positioned at the origin (which makes it way simpler).
