## Methods

### `addCursor(cursor: Cursor, priority?: number | undefined) => Promise<Disposable>`

Adds a cursor to the viewer, and displays it if the cursor has the highest
priority.

Cursors are managed as a prioritized list. A cursor is displayed if it has
the highest priority or if the cursor is the most recently added cursor in
the set of cursors with the same priority.

To remove a cursor, call `dispose()` on the returned disposable.

#### Returns

Type: `Promise<Disposable>`

A disposable that can be used to remove the cursor.

### `getBaseInteractionHandler() => Promise<BaseInteractionHandler | undefined>`



#### Returns

Type: `Promise<BaseInteractionHandler | undefined>`



### `getInteractionHandlers() => Promise<InteractionHandler[]>`



#### Returns

Type: `Promise<InteractionHandler[]>`



### `getJwt() => Promise<string | undefined>`

<span style="color:red">**[DEPRECATED]**</span> Use `token`.<br/><br/>

#### Returns

Type: `Promise<string | undefined>`



### `isSceneReady() => Promise<boolean>`

Returns `true` indicating that the scene is ready to be interacted with.

#### Returns

Type: `Promise<boolean>`



### `load(urn: string) => Promise<void>`

Loads the given scene into the viewer and return a `Promise` that
resolves when the scene has been loaded. The specified scene is
provided as a URN in the following format:

 * `urn:vertexvis:scene:<sceneid>`

#### Returns

Type: `Promise<void>`



### `registerInteractionHandler(interactionHandler: InteractionHandler) => Promise<Disposable>`

Registers and initializes an interaction handler with the viewer. Returns a
`Disposable` that should be used to deregister the interaction handler.

`InteractionHandler`s are used to build custom mouse and touch interactions
for the viewer. Use `<vertex-viewer camera-controls="false" />` to disable
the default camera controls provided by the viewer.

#### Returns

Type: `Promise<Disposable>`

A promise containing the disposable to use to
deregister the handler.

### `registerTapKeyInteraction(keyInteraction: KeyInteraction<TapEventDetails>) => Promise<void>`

Registers a key interaction to be invoked when a specific set of
keys are pressed during a `tap` event.

`KeyInteraction`s are used to build custom keyboard shortcuts for the
viewer using the current state of they keyboard to determine whether
the `fn` should be invoked. Use `<vertex-viewer keyboard-controls="false" />`
to disable the default keyboard shortcuts provided by the viewer.

#### Returns

Type: `Promise<void>`



### `scene() => Promise<Scene>`

Returns an object that is used to perform operations on the `Scene` that's
currently being viewed. These operations include updating items,
positioning the camera and performing hit tests.

#### Returns

Type: `Promise<Scene>`



### `unload() => Promise<void>`

Disconnects the websocket and removes any internal state associated with
the scene.

#### Returns

Type: `Promise<void>`
